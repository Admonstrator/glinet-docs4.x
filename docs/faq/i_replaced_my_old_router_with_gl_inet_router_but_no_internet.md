# I replace my old router with GL.iNet Router but No internet

**Problem**: Router cannot get IP address (DHCP or PPPoE) when you put the cable from ISP to the WAN Interface.

**Cause**: The ISP modem has lock the mac address of your old router. It will not accept new router.

**Solution**: Here are the solutions. Either one should work.

1.   Just clone your old routerâ€™s mac addresss to the new router and it will work immediatelly.

2.   The modem needs a reboot or reset to accept new router. Reboot the modem and try. If it does not work immediatelly, turn the modem off for 30 minutes then turn it on. Then have a try. You can just leave the router and modem connected although the router cannot get IP. Just go to a lunch or sleep. After you come back, it is likely to get IP already.

3.  Call you ISP and tell me you need to change router and ask them to reset the modem.
