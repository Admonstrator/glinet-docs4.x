# INTERNET

The internet configuration interface lets users choose to establish the type of internet connection supported by the router.

Configure the internet network by selecting **INTERNET** in the side menu within the router's web Admin Panel. 

It supports four ways to connect to the internet as listed below:

## Ethernet

Transmit data over an Ethernet cable using an Ethernet cable to connect the router to an active modem or an active network device. This method usually provides the fastest and most reliable Internet connection.

## Repeater

Extend the Wi-Fi coverage area of an existing Wi-Fi network by using a router to receive wireless signals within range and forwarding the signals to a further distance. This method is most useful when a single router does not have enough range to cover the entire usage area.

## Tethering

Establish internet access with connected devices by sharing a smartphoneâ€™s mobile data to the router via cable. This method is most useful when users wants to use the phone's data to access the internet.

## Cellular
 
Connect the router to the internet by inserting a cellular enabled USB modem into the router's USB port. This method is most useful for sharing internet access from a USB modem to all connected devices.

It supports "Dual SIM, Single Standby", which means it can hold two SIM cards for internet access, but only one SIM card can be active at a time, and the user can switch between them.

### Band Masking

You can check to the band signals by click **view more** in **cells info** and decide which band with stronger signal and which band with weaker signal. Then you can force your router just connect to bands you want or never connect to some bands you don't want.

## Priority and load balance

Go to [Multi-WAN](../../../tutorials/multi-wan/) to set the priority of each Internet access method or the load balance when multiple Internet access methods are used at the same time.
