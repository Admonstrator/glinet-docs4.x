# Hardware info

GL-XE3000 (Puli AX) is a Wi-Fi 6 cellular gateway designed to provide reliable cellular networks in remote locations and high speed internet in urban areas. It has six external antennas for long range connection, two SIM Cards for selecting between the ISP with stronger connections, and Multi-WAN between the WAN port, SIM Card, and Repeater.

It supports "Dual SIM, Single Standby", which means it can hold two SIM cards for internet access, but only one SIM card can be active at a time, and the user can switch between them.
