# VPN

GL.iNet routers are pre-installed with OpenVPN and WireGuardÂ® supporting 30+ VPN services. It automatically encrypts all network traffic within the connected network, including guest devices and client devices that are not capable of running VPN encryption. Our routers can also act as VPN servers, redirecting traffic from client devices in remote locations to the VPN server via a VPN tunnel before accessing the public internet.
