Slate AX supports four ways to connect to the internet as listed below:

## Ethernet

## Repeater

Repeater
Extend the Wi-Fi coverage area of an existing Wi-Fi network by using a router to receive wireless signals within range and forwarding the signals to a further distance. This method is most useful when a single router does not have enough range to cover the entire usage area.
