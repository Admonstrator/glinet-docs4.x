# MAC Address

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> MAC Address

The Mac Address page was previously called Mac Clone and has been changed to Mac Address since v4.2.

You can find the router's default Mac Address on this page, clone a Client's Mac Address, enter a Mac Address manually or generate a random Mac Address.

## Usage Scenarios

When you connect to a public hotspot, use a random MAC address if you do not want the hotspot to know your real MAC address or to limit your access to the Internet based on it. Please read this guide [Connect to a Hotspot with Captive Portal](../connect_to_a_hotspot_with_captive_portal).
