**Note**: This feature is currently in beta, and may be problematic in some countries. When Tor is enabled, the following features will not work properly: 

  - VPN
  - DNS
  - IPv6
  - ADGuard Home. 

Just toggle to enable it, then click **Apply** button. You can also choose a **Custom Exit Nodes**.

Wait a while, depending on your network, and it will show connected.
