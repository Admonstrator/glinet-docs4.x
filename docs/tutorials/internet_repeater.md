# Connect to the Internet via an existing Wi-Fi by Repeater

Using Repeater means connecting the router to another existing wireless network, e.g. when you are using free Wi-Fi in a hotel or cafe.

It works in WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) mode by default, which means that the router will create its own subnet and act as a firewall to protect you from the public network.

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> INTERNET, Repeater sector.

* **Allow Switching To Other Saved Network**. If the option is enabled, the router will automatically connect to other saved networks when it is unable to connect to the current Wi-Fi network.

* **Band Selection**. If you manually select a band, the router will not scan or connect to any Wi-Fi with another band.

* **Allow Repeat DFS Channels**. If the option is enabled, 5GHz Wi-Fi will be temporarily unavailable when a radar is using the channel which is currently router using; Otherwise, the router will not connect to any Wi-Fi using DFS channels.
