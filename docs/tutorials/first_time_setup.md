# First time setup

The first setup of the GL.iNet router is very similar, here is the example of GL-AXT1800(Slate AX).

Please prepare the following items that included in the package.

1. Power on

    If you want to use TF card, please insert before powering on the router. Hot plugging for TF card is not supported.

    Plug one end of the power adapter into the router and the other end into an outlet. It will automatically power on.

2. Connect to the router

    You can connect to router via an ethernet cable or via Wi-Fi.

    * Connect via cable

        Connect your computer to the LAN port of the router via Ethernet cable.

        The SSID was printed on the bottom label of the router with the following formats:

        **GL-AXT1800-XXX** or **GL-AXT1800-XXX-5G**

        Search for the SSID of the router in your computer/phone/tablet and input the default password: **goodlife**.
