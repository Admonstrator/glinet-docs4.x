# First time setup

The first setup of the GL.iNet router is very similar, here is the example of GL-AXT1800(Slate AX).

Please prepare the following items that included in the package.

GL-AXT1800, power adapter, ethernet cable.

1. Power on

    If you want to use TF card, please insert before powering on the router. Hot plugging for TF card is not supported.

    Plug one end of the power adapter into the router and the other end into an outlet. It will automatically power on.

2. Connect to the router

    You can connect to router via an ethernet cable or via Wi-Fi.

    * Connect via cable

        Connect your computer to the LAN port of the router via Ethernet cable.

    * Connect via Wi-Fi

        The SSID was printed on the bottom label of the router with the following formats:

        **GL-AXT1800-XXX** or **GL-AXT1800-XXX-5G**

        Search for the SSID of the router in your computer/phone/tablet and input the WiFi password. Please find the WiFi password on the label on the back of the router. Some models if you can't find the WiFi password on the label, please try the default password **goodlife**.

        **Tip:** The QR code on the label on the back of the GL-AXT1800 is with wifi connection information and can be quickly connected using your phone's QR code scanning tool.

3. Access the web Admin Panel

    Open a web browser (we recommend Chrome, Edge, Safari) and visit [http://192.168.8.1](http://192.168.8.1). You will be directed to the initial setup of the web Admin Panel.

    Choose a language, and click **Next** to continue.
