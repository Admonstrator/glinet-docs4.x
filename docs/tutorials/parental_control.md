# Parental Control

Parental control feature available since V4.2

## Setup

Make sure the time on your router is correct, otherwise, go to Time Zone and synchronize the time first.

Let's take two typical cases as examples here, and you can make adjustments to suit your situation.

### Case 1

In the first case, the device is not connected to the Internet by default.

We will create two rulesets, **learning** and **play**, then set the learning time from Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 11 AM, 6 PM to 8 PM of weekend is the play time.

![parental control, enable](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/parental_control_enable.png){class="glboxshadow"}

The first time, it will have a setup wizard.

Give the profile a name.

![create a profile guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_profile_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Select the devices you want to manage, or manually add device by input their MAC address.

![create a profile guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_profile_2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

The default ruleset of access is **Block Internet Access**. We create two rulesets here, which we will use later. Click **Add a New Ruleset**.

![create a profile guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_profile_3.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Specify the ruleset name, color, and a list of sites to block.

![create a ruleset guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_ruleset_4.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Similarly, create another ruleset.

![create a ruleset guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_ruleset_5.png){class="glboxshadow"}

At this point, there will be a total of 4 rulesets. Choose **Block Internet Access**.

![create a profile guide](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_create_profile_6.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Then go to Set Schedule. Click **Go to Set**.

![set schedule](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_schedule_7.png){class="glboxshadow"}

It is assumed that 8 AM to 11 AM Monday through Friday is the study time, and the ruleset here is **Learning**. Click **Apply**.

![set schedule](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/guide/guide_schedule_8.png){class="glboxshadow"}

You will be taken to the edit page of the newly created profile.

![modify profile](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/modify_profile.png){class="glboxshadow"}

It has created a schedule. Click **Add Schedule** 

![schedule](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/schedules_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Specify the ruleset name, color, and a list of sites to block.

![add a schedule](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/create_schedule_2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

After creation, the Schedules are shown below.

![schedules](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/schedules_2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Click on the purple and green parts of the image above, and you can also modify it.

![edit schedule](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/4/tutorials/parental_control/schedule_edit.png){class="glboxshadow"}

As shown below, click Parental Control at the top to return to the Parental Control page.
