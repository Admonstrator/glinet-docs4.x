# Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration reduces CPU load and speeds up traffic packet forwarding, but can conflict with some features.

When hardware acceleration is enabled, the following functions will not work properly: Port Forwards, Client Speed and Traffic Statistics, VPN Policy(Global Options and Proxy Mode).

The following models have this option.

GL-MT2500, GL-MT2500A, GL-MT1300
