# Setup WireGuard Server on GL.iNet router

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes **state-of-the-art cryptography**. It aims to be [faster](https://www.wireguard.com/performance/){target="_blank"}, [simpler](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/){target="_blank"}, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. 

GL.iNet routers have pre-installed WireGuard Server and Client.

## Make sure Internet Service Provider assigns you a public IP address

Please check if you Internet Service Provider assigns you a public IP address [here](../how_to_check_if_isp_assigns_you_a_public_ip_address).

**If no, you can't connect to the WireGaurd Server.**

An alternative method is to use a reverse proxy solution, we suggest [AstroRelay](https://www.astrorelay.com/){target="_blank"}.

## Network Topology

* If GL.iNet router is the main router in your network, this is simple, please move to the next step.
* If you already have a main router, then the GL.iNet router is under the main router, you may need to setup a port forwarding on the main router.
* If you already have a main router, the GL.iNet router is several levels below it and you need to set up port forward on each level.
