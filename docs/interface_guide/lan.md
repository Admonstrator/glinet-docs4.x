## Reserve an IP for a client

When you specify a reserved IP address for a client within the LAN, the client always receives the same IP address each time it accesses the routerâ€™s DHCP server. You can assign reserved IP addresses to computers or servers that require permanent IP settings.

**Note:** Configured clients have to reconnect the router to activate.

Click **Add** to reserve an IP.

Select the **MAC**, it will fill the **IP** automatically after select MAC. Give it a descriptive name. Then click **Submit**.
